## Overview and Components

MobiLyzer is a novel system for fine-grained analysis of liquids using commodity smartphones.  
It integrates physics-based modeling, machine learning, and mobile deployment to support tasks such as:  

- **Fraud detection** (e.g., adulterated olive oil)  
- **Quality assessment** (e.g., Extra virgin olive oil vs Refined olive oil)  
- **Origin labeling** (e.g., Italian olive oil vs American olive oil)
- **composition labeling** (Fat, Protein, and sugar composition analysis)
- **Medical diagnostics** (e.g., urine analysis)

The repository is organized into four main modules:

1. **Intrinsic Decomposition**  
   Separation of reflectance and illumination components to recover material properties.

2. **Hyperspectral Reconstruction**  
   Truthful reconstruction of spectral signatures from RGB smartphone images.  

3. **Liquid Analysis**  
    classification for fraud detection, composition analysis, and diagnosis.  

4. **Mobile Application**  
   A lightweight Android app for real-time liquid analysis on smartphones. [Link â€“ pending]()
